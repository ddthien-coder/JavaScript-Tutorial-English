### Comment Your JavaScript CodePassed

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

```bash
// This is an in-line comment.
```

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:

```bash
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```
