### Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15

```bash
var sum = 10 + 10;
```
